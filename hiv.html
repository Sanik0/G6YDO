                            which helps our bodies fight infections. If someone has HIV and does not get treatment, it can lead
                            to AIDS, a serious condition that makes it very hard for the body to fight off diseases.

                        <h1>How to Prevent HIV</h1>
                        <p>To prevent getting HIV, it is important to know a few things. First, the best way to avoid HIV is
                            to not have sex. If you do have sex, always use condoms. Condoms help stop the virus from
                            spreading. There is also a medicine called PrEP that people who do not have HIV can take to lower
                            their chances of getting it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <h1>TOOLS TO PREVENT HIV:</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Talk to your partners and friends about condoms. There are more HIV prevention options
                                than ever before, and condoms are still a highly effective option to prevent both HIV and
                                other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If you use them the right way every time you
                                have sex, condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV infection. But it’s important to
                                educate yourself about how to use them the right way.                                
                            </li>
                            <li>Condoms can also help prevent other STDs you can get through body fluids, like gonorrhea
                                and chlamydia. However, they provide less protection against STDs spread through skinto-skin contact, like human papillomavirus or HPV (genital warts), genital herpes, and
                                syphilis.
                            </li>
                            <li>- PrEP can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout your body. It is highly
                                effective for preventing HIV if used as prescribed. And remember, PrEP protects you
                                against HIV but not against other sexual transmitted diseases (STDs).

                        <p>PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is medicine that reduces your chances of getting HIV from sex
                            or injection drug use. When taken as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective for preventing HIV.

                                taken as prescribed. Currently, PrEP shots are not recommended for people who inject
                                drugs.

                        <h1>What is HIV treatment?</h1>
                        <p>HIV treatment (antiretroviral therapy or ART) involves taking medicine as prescribed by a health
                            care provider. HIV treatment reduces the amount of HIV in your body and helps you stay healthy.

                            <li>There is no cure for HIV, but you can control it with HIV treatment.

                            <li>Most people can get the virus under control within six months
                                can help you find the right one for you.

                        <h1>The Risks of Ignoring HIV?</h1>
                        <p>Not knowing about HIV can be dangerous. If a person does not get tested, they may unknowingly
                            spread the virus to others. There is also a lot of stigma around HIV, which can make people feel
                            ashamed or scared to talk about it.

                        <p>In the Philippines, there are programs that help educate people about HIV. One such organization
                            is LoveYourself, Inc., which provides testing and counseling. The Philippine National AIDS
                            Council also has programs to help prevent and treat HIV.

                        <h1>Why Education is Important</h1>
                        <p>Learning about HIV is important for young people. When they understand how to prevent the virus
                            and know about treatment options, they can make better choices. Education can help lower the
                            number of new infections.
