                        <h1>How does online gaming addiction develop?</h1>
                        <p>Online gaming addiction develops when a person seeks the “dopamine high” that is experienced
                            when winning an online game, according to a 2022 article, “Video Game Addiction,” published
                            on ClevelandClinic. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter produced by the brain that communicates
                            between nerve cells, and it links pleasurable feelings to certain behaviors, which motivates certain
                            actions.                            
                        </p>
                        <p>According to Amy Paturel in her 2014 article published in Brain & Life Magazine, excessive
                            exposure to online games can lead to a diminished supply in dopamine production during daily
                            activities. This causes the person to become bored and rely on video games to offer a dopamine
                            surge and thus become addicted to online games.

                        <h1> Preoccupation with gaming
                        </h1>
                        <p>A preoccupation with gaming refers to repeated participation in, obsessive thinking about, and
                            consistent talking about gaming. It often leads to significant concentration issues in daily work and
                            or educational tasks.
                            A person’s preoccupation with gaming might start to bleed into their self-care, social life, and
                            overall academic/career performance. This level of impact indicates that the person’s gaming
                            habits may be turning into a more serious problem that warrants attention and support.

                        <h1> Deception and secrecy
                        </h1>
                        <p>Deception and secrecy are behaviors displayed by people who are trying to hide something. In this
                            context, a person battling with excessive online gaming habits might try to hide these habits.
                            Deception and secrecy are frequently utilized by gamers to disguise the degree of their online
                            gaming activities from friends and family.
                            When a person repeatedly hides or downplays their gaming habits, avoids revealing the extent of
                            their gaming, and makes attempts to keep their gaming behavior secret from others, it is an
                            indication of online gaming addiction. These behaviors suggest a potential lack of control over
                            gaming habits as well as a preference for gaming over other obligations.

                            Avoiding obligations to play online games often leads to poor performance in school, work, or
                            other duties, according to Traci Pedersen, in her 2023 article “Gaming Addiction Symptoms You
                            May Want to Look Out For,” published on Healthline.

                        <p>Online gaming addicts can feel a complete loss of control over their addiction. They may believe
                            that they are incapable of managing their own gaming behavior, according to a 2022 article
                            written by Edward Luker and published by the Mayo Clinic Health System. Many online gaming
                            addicts feel this loss of control over their gaming habits.

                            that they once enjoyed. This typically happens without the individual realizing it and might grow
                            gradually over time.

                            problems or conflicts in their life. In this case, an individual would use online gaming to take their
                            mind off any problems.

                            the clear signs of an addiction.

                        <p>Failed attempts to cut down refers to unsuccessfully trying to reduce or manage one’s dependence
                            on a substance or behavioral pattern. Often this dependence also has a negative impact on one’s
                            daily life. When an addict has failed to cut down on their dependence, additional support from
                            friends and family becomes crucial.

                            Isolation.” Most often, addicts isolate themselves due to shame or guilt of their addiction or trying

                        <p>Common triggers that could lead to excessive online gaming include the desire to escape from
                            real-life stressors (escapism), the allure of virtual rewards, or the desire to connect with others
                            through a shared hobby.                                                                             
                        </p>
                        <p>Many of the risks of an online gaming addiction overlap with the triggers that could lead to
                            excessive gaming. These triggers can contribute to the development of unhealthy gaming
                            behaviors, resulting in obligations being neglected, sleep habits being disrupted, and interpersonal
                            connections being strained.
