                        <h1>What is the difference between sexual harassment and sexual assault? What about sexual
                            misconduct?
                        </h1>
                        <p>Sexual harassment is a broad term, including many types of unwelcome verbal and physical sexual
                            attention. Sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior, often physical, that occurs without
                            the consent of the victim. Sexual harassment generally violates civil laws—you have a right to
                            work or learn without being harassed—but in many cases is not a criminal act, while sexual assault
                            usually refers to acts that are criminal. Some forms of sexual assault include:                            
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Penetration of the victim’s body, also known as rape.
                            </li>
                            <li>Attempted rape.                                
                            </li>
                            <li>Forcing a victim to perform sexual acts, such as oral sex or penetration of the
                                perpetrator’s body.
                            </li>
                            <li>Fondling or unwanted sexual touching.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sexual misconduct is a non-legal term used informally to describe a broad range of behaviors,
                            which may or may not involve harassment. For example, some companies prohibit sexual
                            relationships between coworkers, or between an employee and their boss, even if the relationship
                            is consensual.

                        <h1>Where can sexual harassment occur?</h1>
                        <p>Sexual harassment can occur in the workplace or learning environment, like a school or university.
                            It can happen in many different scenarios, including after-hours conversations, exchanges in the
                            hallways, and non-office settings of employees or peers.

                        <h1>What can I do when I witness sexual harassment?</h1>
                        <p>You may have heard the term <a href="https://rainn.org/articles/your-role-preventing-sexual-assault">bystander intervention</a> to describe stepping in to help if you see
                            someone who might be in danger or at risk for sexual assault. Bystander intervention can also be
                            a helpful strategy if you witness sexual harassment. You don’t have to be a hero to make a positive
                            impact in someone’s life, and you can intervene in a way that fits your comfort level and is
                            appropriate for the situation. If you choose to step in, you may be able to give the person being
                            harassed a chance to get to a safe place or leave the situation. Below are some of the steps you can
                            take if you see someone being sexually harassed—just remember to C.A.R.E., and of course, keep
                            your own safety in mind at all times.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <span class="bold">Create a distraction: </span>Do what you can to interrupt the harassment, or distract
                                those taking part in the harassment. But remember to make sure that you aren’t
                                putting yourself in danger by doing this. If someone seems like they could become
                                violent, do not draw their attention.                                
                            </li>                                         
                            <li> <span class="bold">Ask directly: </span> Talk directly with the person who is being harassed. If they are
                                being harassed at work or school, offer to accompany them anytime they have to
                                meet with the harasser. If a friend is worried about walking alone to their car at
                                night, offer to walk with them.                       
                            </li>                                         
                            <li> <span class="bold">Refer to an authority: </span>The safest way to intervene for both you and the person
                                being harassed may be to bring in an authority figure. You can talk to another
                                employee, security guard, RA in your dorm, bartender, or bouncer, and they will
                                often be willing to step in.

                            <li> <span class="bold">Enlist others: </span> It can be hard to step in alone, especially if you are worried about
                                your own safety or if you don’t think you will be able to help on your own. It may
                                be a good idea to enlist the help of a friend or another bystander.

                        <h1>Federal Law</h1>
                        <p>Legally, workplace sexual harassment is considered a form of sex discrimination, so sexual
                            harassment is illegal across the country. Generally, these federal (national) laws apply only to
                            employers with 15 or more employees, but your state might have better laws that cover smaller
                            employers.                                                        
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sexual harassment is illegal. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) makes
                                it illegal for employers to allow anyone to be sexually harassed at work by anyone else,
                                regardless of sex, gender, or sexual orientation.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sexual harassment can happen to anyone. It is about power, not sexual desire. So
                                        for example, men who identify as straight can sexually harass other men – for
                                        example, by teasing or bullying those men for being “too feminine” or “acting gay.”
                                        (For examples of sexual harassment, see the What Is It? section above.)                                        
                                    </li>
                                    <li>o Title VII applies to employers. It is designed to make employers accountable for
                                        providing a work environment that is free from harassment and other kinds of
                                        discrimination. It does not make it illegal for someone to harass someone else.
                                        Instead, it makes it illegal for
                                        <span class="bold"> employers to allow harassment to occur or to fail
                                            to stop it once they know it’s happening.</span> So this civil rights law does <span class="bold">not</span> give
                                        you a right to sue an individual person – unless that individual person is your
                                        employer.

                            <li> <span class="bold">Retaliation is also illegal:</span> It’s illegal for someone at work to retaliate against (punish) you
                                for reporting or speaking out against sexual harassment, or for participating in an
                                investigation or legal action related to sexual harassment. Examples of retaliation in the
                                workplace include being fired or demoted, receiving a pay cut or a reduction in your hours
                                or benefits, being assigned a different shift, location, position, receiving new or different
                                duties, or being asked to take time off without pay. Retaliation can also be subtle, build up,
                                or get worse over time. Examples include being iced out by coworkers, no longer being
                                invited to meetings, or being left off of communications you were formerly on.                                
                            </li>
                            <li> <span class="bold">If you report sexual harassment, your employer cannot ignore you or retaliate against
                                you: </span>If a boss or someone in HR knows about the harassment, or should know that you are
                                being harassed, legally, they must take prompt action to try to stop the behavior,
                                investigate the harassment, and make sure it doesn’t happen again. The action also has to
                                be “appropriate” and effective, meaning it has to actually make the harassment stop,
                                without harming you or allowing you to become a target of retaliation.
                                <ul>

                                        harassment, and they failed to do anything to make the situation better (or made it
                                        worse), you could consider taking legal action.
